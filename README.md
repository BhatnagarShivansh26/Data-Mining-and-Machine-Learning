# Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning
Data Mining and Machine Learning Projects (Predictive Models, Text Analytics and Visualization)

The project investigates data from three distinct domains with 
machine learning techniques: Airbnb bookings, Patient health 
data analysis and ChatGPT reviews text analysis.The aim is to 
predict the features affecting room price in Barcelona, identifying 
stroke risk factors, and sentiment analysis of chatgpt reviews. The 
Airbnb dataset consisted of 19,833 records covering neighborhood 
details, price of room and Amenities information.XgBoost yielded 
74.24% accuracy in predicting the room cost in Barcelona.For 
healthcare,I have considered the dataset containing 237,630 
related to the demographics and health conditions of patients 
achieved 81% accuracy with Random Forest Classifier. The 
ChatGPT review dataset comprises 291,878 entries and evaluated 
sentiment analysis(Positive, Neutral, and Negative categories 
based on text reviews) and user rating with logistic regression and 
random forest excelled with 80% and 84%, respectively. Overall, 
the project highlights the applicability of machine learning models 
in various fields, thereby making them applicable for predictive 
analytics in real-world applications.
